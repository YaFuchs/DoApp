## Troubleshooting

### `react-native-emoji-selector` not found

If you encounter a build error mentioning that `react-native-emoji-selector` cannot be
resolved, install the dependency manually:

```bash
npm install react-native-emoji-selector
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-native-emoji-selector
```

Make sure the package is compatible with your environment (for example Expo managed
projects) or replace it with an alternative emoji picker if needed.
